# JacobLang
## A small lexical analyzer and syntax analyzer for a made up language called JacobLang

### October 10th, 2017
After making a lexical and syntactic analyzer for my Compilers class, I wanted to make one alongside our class projects for my own enjoyment. The langugae is called JacobLang, and I am goiong to try to make it a fusion of Scheme and some Branching language (For class we have 'Branch441').

JacobLang will support your spanglish needs from now on. The syntax will be written in Spanglish, litteraly a mix of Spanish words and English words. All multi-word keywords will either start with an English word and follow with a mix of Spanish and English, or be entirely in Spanish. Why would someone do that? Code-switching is pretty cool in my opinion. I found a markup language called Creole, but I think this would be the first actual creole programming language
