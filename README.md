# JacobLang
## A small lexical analyzer and syntax analyzer for a made up language called JacobLang

### October 10th, 2017
After making a lexical and syntactic analyzer for my Compilers class, I wanted to make one alongside our class projects for my own enjoyment. The langugae is called JacobLang, and I am goiong to try to make it a fusion of Scheme and some Branching language (For class we have 'Branch441').
